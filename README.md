Vanam AI Post Generator
This is a simple, powerful, single-page web application that uses Generative AI (Groq & Llama 3.1) to help you write new LinkedIn posts that perfectly match your unique writing style.
It's a "zero-install" projectâ€”it runs entirely in your browser from a single index.html file.

Ultra-Fast Generation: Uses the Groq API (running llama-3.1-8b-instant) for near-instant results.
Utility Features:
Copy to Clipboard: Instantly copy the generated post.

ðŸš€ How to Run This Project
This project is designed for simplicity. You don't need to install any software (like Node.js, npm, or Python).
Step 1: Get Your Free Groq API Key
Go to the Groq Console: https://console.groq.com/keys
Sign up for a free account (you can use your Google or GitHub account).
Once on the "API Keys" page, click "+ Create API Key".
Name your key (e.g., "vanam-ai-project") and click "Create".
Copy the key that starts with gsk_...
Step 2: Add Your Key to index.html
Download or clone this repository.
Open the index.html file in any code editor (like VS Code, Sublime Text, or even Notepad).
Scroll down to line 382 (or find the line const API_KEY = "";).
You will see this line:
const API_KEY = ""; // <-- PASTE YOUR GROQ API KEY HERE


Paste your Groq API key (the one you just copied) inside the quotes:
const API_KEY = "gsk_YourPersonalKeyGoesHere..."; // <-- PASTE YOUR GROQ API KEY HERE


Save the index.html file.
